Handwritten Digit Classifier 🧠✍️
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset. The model takes grayscale images of digits (0–9) and predicts the correct label with high accuracy.

Features
1. Trained on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training + 10,000 test images)

2. Built using PyTorch

3. Supports custom digit image prediction
